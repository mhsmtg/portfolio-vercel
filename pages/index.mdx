# Muhammad Hassan Mughal

Hey, I'm a Civil Engineer. I enjoy working with technology and crafting beautiful experiences.

This website is a brief reflection of my personality, research findings, publications, achievements, and affiliations.

Passionate about research and delivering innovation that leads to impact.
Seeking to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.

I’m passionate about innovation and driven by impact.

I, therefore, really enjoy working on cutting-edge projects and developing enabling new technologies in the hope that these will one day translate back to the real world and have a direct impact to our lives. I also enjoy being surrounded by brilliant people that share my vision of “technology for good” and I’m truly humbled by their support in me. Meanwhile, I’m excited by the ever-growing challenges I’m faced with as my career unfolds, and keen to taking them on. I enjoy creating things that live both in real world & on the internet, whether that be buildings, roads, bridges, websites, desktop or mobile applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences. I love learning new and better ways to create impact with clean, efficient, and scalable energy.At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that bring out the best in me.
